    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture 16, we talked about natural language processing (NLP). Using pre-trained word embeddings is very common in NLP. It has been shown that pre-trained word embeddings [work well on a variety of text classification tasks](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/721.pdf). These embeddings are created by training a model like Word2Vec on a huge corpus of text such as a dump of Wikipedia or a dump of the web crawl. \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of pre-trained word embeddings are available out there. Some popular ones are: \n",

    "    * trained using [the GloVe algorithm](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) \n",

    "Write up your analysis from hw6 or any other assignment or your side project on machine learning in a \"blog post\" or report format. It's fine if you just write it here in this notebook. Alternatively, you can publish your blog post publicly and include a link here. (See exercise 4.3.) The target audience for your blog post is someone like yourself right before you took this course. They don't necessarily have ML knowledge, but they have a solid foundation in technical matters. The post should focus on explaining **your results and what you did** in a way that's understandable to such a person, **not** a lesson trying to teach someone about machine learning. Again: focus on the results and why they are interesting; avoid pedagogical content.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Description of the problem/decision.\n",
    "- Description of the dataset (the raw data and/or some EDA).\n",
    "- Description of the model.\n",
    "- Description your results, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Make sure to refer to the original problem/decision.\n",
    "- A section on caveats, describing at least 3 reasons why your results might be incorrect, misleading, overconfident, or otherwise problematic. Make reference to your specific dataset, model, approach, etc. To check that your reasons are specific enough, make sure they would not make sense, if left unchanged, to most students' submissions; for example, do not just say \"overfitting\" without explaining why you might be worried about overfitting in your specific case.\n",
    "- At least 3 visualizations. These visualizations must be embedded/interwoven into the text, not pasted at the end. The text must refer directly to each visualization. For example \"as shown below\" or \"the figure demonstrates\" or \"take a look at Figure 1\", etc. It is **not** sufficient to put a visualization in without referring to it directly.\n",
